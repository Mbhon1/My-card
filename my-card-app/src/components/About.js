                I am a web developer with a background in networking. 
                I have always been interested in technology and have a 
                strong foundation in computer systems. Recently, 
                I have been focusing on learning web development 
                and have been enjoying the challenge of building 
                dynamic and interactive websites. 
                I am constantly striving to improve 
                my skills and stay up-to-date with the 
                latest technologies in the field.
